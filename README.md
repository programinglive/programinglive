Programmer hoods... Here, we build an army of programmers.

## What is Programinglive?

ProgrammingLive is a community made up of people who love to code and incorporate programming into their lives.

## Why Programinglive?

Coding can sometimes feel monotonous. Therefore, we need to make it more enjoyable and foster collaboration, so we don't feel isolated in our daily coding tasks.
